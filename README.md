Tomography tools - WIP

There is no installation procedure right now. You need to add the directory
containing the modules to your PYTHONPATH and import them.

Requirements
------------

- python-future (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/) as Python 2/3 compatibility layer
- pyFFTW (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFFTW) for uniform FFT
- pyNFFT (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyNFFT/) for non-uniform FFT
- numexpr (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numexpr) for faster numerical expressions
