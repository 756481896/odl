"""Denoising using the Chambolle-Pock solver with TV & entropy-type data term.

Let X and Y be finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and K a linear mapping
from X to Y with induce norm ||K||. The (primal) minimization problem we
want to solve is

    min_{x in X} F(K x) + G(x)

where F : Y -> [0, +infinity] and G : X -> [0, +infinity] are the proper,
convex, lower-semicontinuous functional. The primal objective is given by
the indicator function for the set fo non-negative components of x

    G(x) = ind_P(x) {0 if x >=0, infinity if x < 0}.

The dual objective reads F(y,z) = F_KL(y) + F_TV(z) with the Kullback-Leibler
data divergence

    F_KL(y) = sum_i (y - g + g ln(g) - g ln(pos(y)))_i + ind_P(y)

and the isotropic total variation regularization

    F_TV(z) = lam || |z| ||_1

Here, g denotes the image to denoise, ln the point-wise logarithm, pos the
non-negativity thresholding,  ||.||_1 the l1-semi-norm, grad the spatial
gradient, lam the regularization parameter, |.| the point-wise magnitude
across the vector components of z = grad(x), and K is a column vector of
operators K = (id, grad)^T with identity mapping id.

In order to use the Chambolle-Pock solver, we have to create the column
operator K, choose a starting point x, create the proximal operator for G,
create the proximal operator for the convex conjugate of F, choose the
step sizes tau and sigma such that tau sigma ||K||_2^2 < 1, and set the
total number of iterations.

For details see :ref:`chambolle_pock`, :ref:`proximal_operators`, and
references therein.
