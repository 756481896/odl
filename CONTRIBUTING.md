How to contribute
=================

You're reading this, so you actually so you actually want to contribute. Good! Please read on and don't feel intimidated by the amount of information. You can start slowly, at the beginning of this document, and gradually work your way down as you become more familiar with the workflow. If you already have experience with development GitHub, you may want to skip to ???

Get the code and use it
-----------------------

If you haven't already got your copy of ODL, clone the repository and start using the library. Check out [the instructions in the documentation](https://odl.readthedocs.org/dev/dev.html)

A good starting point are the [examples](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl-examples). If you want to find out how a particular function or class works, the [tests](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/test) are worth a look since they give simple example code for each feature separately.

Use the issue tracker
---------------------

- Ask questions on the issue tracker
- Fork, branch, pull request - the git workflow
- Coding style, documentation, names, PEP8, Pylint, PEP257, whitespace, long lines, ...
