\section{Introduction}
In many applications one works with mappings between infinite dimensional vector spaces.
To numerically deal with such mappings, one is forced to find a finite dimensional 
representation for the infinite dimensional vector spaces. The process of reducing a
infinite dimensional vector spaces to a finite dimensional one is called \emph{discretization}.
A discretization of a specific infinite dimensional vector space is intimately 
tied to the numerical methodology that one eventually wishes to use. However, many concepts
and results about  discretizations can be stated in a general framework, so there is 
a general mathematical theory describing the discretization process of infinite dimensional 
vector spaces.  

Most complex numerical software packages work with several 
different discretizations, even of the same vector space. The general mathematical 
theory that formalizes the process of discretization yields consistency 
checks and recipes for how to go between two discretizations. Still, most numerical software 
packages do not utilize such consistency checks and, even though changes between two 
discretizations are explicitly coded, this code is often scattered throughout  and even 
repeated in different parts of the software package.  

To minimize software bugs, it is therefore desirable to be able to abstract and isolate those parts 
of the code that deal with the discretization. To achieve this, the software must be able to represent 
the abstract process of
discretization and an object oriented framework is the most suitable. We will in this note try 
to describe those parts of the abstract mathematical theory that needs to be captured by 
the numerical software package in able to achieve the above stated goals. We  start 
by giving the basic mathematical foundations.


\section{The general discretization problem}
In many cases, such as inverse problems arising in applications,  one has to deal with 
the following problem: Let $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$ be infinite dimensional vector spaces and 
$\Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{Y}$. Consider now the following problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:OpEq}
   \text{Given $g\in \VecSpace{Y}$, find $f\in \VecSpace{X}$ such that}\quad \Op{T}(f)=g. 
\end{equation}
The operator $\Op{T}$ can either be given explicitly by a closed form expression, or it can be defined 
implicitly, \eg, as a solution operator to a differential equation. 

In order to numerically work with \eqref{eq:OpEq} in a software package, one must replace the 
infinite dimensional vector spaces $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$ with some finite dimensional 
counterparts $\Field^{n}$ and $\Field^{m}$, and the map 
$\Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{Y}$ with an appropriate
the following system of (linear or nonlinear) equations with finitely many unknowns:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DiscOpEq}
  \text{Given $g_{m} \in \Field^{m}$, find $f_n \in \Field^{n}$ such that }\quad \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} (f_{n})=g_{m}. 
\end{equation}
The above process of replacing \eqref{eq:OpEq} with \eqref{eq:DiscOpEq} is referred to 
as \emph{discretization} of \eqref{eq:OpEq}. A general theory of discretizations is outlined in 
\cite[Chapter~34]{ZeIIB85}, see also \cite{Pe93}, but the results are of little use for ill-posed inverse 
problems since the discretized problem \eqref{eq:DiscOpEq} does not fulfill the requirements.
\emph{In this note we only consider a discretization of \eqref{eq:OpEq} 
as a way of reducing an equation in infinite dimensional setting to an equation 
\eqref{eq:DiscOpEq} in a finite dimensional setting.}
Thus, we now properly define we mean by a discretization of an 
infinite dimensional vector space.
\begin{definition}
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be a vector space over a field $\Field$. An \emph{$n$-dimensional discretization 
  $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$} is determined by the tuple 
  \[
     \discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}) := \bigl\{ \VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n} \bigr\} 
  \]
  where 
  $R_{n} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \Field^{n}$, and $E_{n} \colon \Field^{n} \to \VecSpace{X}$.
  The maps $R_{n}$ and $E_{n}$ are called the  \emph{restriction} and 
  \emph{extension} maps associated with the discretization. $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ is a 
  \emph{linear discretization} whenever both these maps are linear.
\end{definition}

\begin{examp}
We begin with considering the case where $\VecSpace{X}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\Field$. 
Then $\VecSpace{X}$ is then isomorphic to $\Field^{n}$, so we may choose 
$E_{n}:=R_{n}:=\Id$. The resulting discretization $\{ \Field^n,\Field^n,\Id,\Id \}$ is called the  
\emph{identity discretization}. 
\end{examp}

\begin{examp}
Another common discretization for an $n$-dimensional vector space $\VecSpace{X}$ is to first consider 
a basis $B:=\{ v_1,\ldots,v_{n}\}$ of $\VecSpace{X}$. Any element $x\in \VecSpace{X}$ can then 
be written as $x=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i$ for unique $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}\in\Field$, so we define 
\[
   R_{n}(x) := (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}) \quad\text{and}\quad
   E_{n}(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}) := \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i. 
\]
The resulting discretization $\{ \VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n}\}$ is called the \emph{standard discretization
w.r.t.\@ the basis $B$}.
\end{examp}

In mathematics it is rather common to construct a new vector space from a collection of vector spaces. If the 
vector spaces in this collection all have discretizations, then one can use these discretizations to 
define a natural discretization on the aforementioned new vector space. In the sections that follow, we shall see
examples of this.

\subsection{Discretizations of product spaces}
Let $\VecSpace{X}_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$ be vector spaces over $\Field$ with $n_i$-dimensional 
discretizations $\discr_{n_i}(\VecSpace{X}_i)$ given as 
\[
     \discr_{n_i}(\VecSpace{X}_i) := \bigl\{ \VecSpace{X}_i,\Field^{n_i},R_{n_i},E_{n_i} \bigr\}. 
\]
Then we can define a natural $N$-dimensional discretization, with $N:=n_1+\ldots+n_k$, of the product vector space 
$\VecSpace{X} := \VecSpace{X}_1 \times \ldots \times \VecSpace{X}_k$ as 
\[ \discr_{N}(\VecSpace{X}):=\{\VecSpace{X},\Field^{n_1}  \times \ldots \times \Field^{n_k},R_{N}^{\VecSpace{X}},E_{N}^{\VecSpace{X}} \} \]
where
\begin{align*}
   R_{N}^{\VecSpace{X}}(x_1,\ldots,x_k) &:= \bigl( R_{n_1}(x_1),\ldots,R_{n_k}(x_k) \bigr)
      \quad\text{for $x_i\in \VecSpace{X}_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$} \\
   E_{N}^{\VecSpace{X}}(a_1,\ldots,a_k)  &:=  \bigl( E_{n_1}(a_1),\ldots,E_{n_k}(a_k) \bigr) 
     \quad\text{for $a_i \in \Field^{n_i}$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$.}
\end{align*}
The discretization 
$ \discr_{N}(\VecSpace{X})$ is referred to as the \emph{product discretization of $\VecSpace{X}$}. Some special cases are 
when $\VecSpace{X}:=\Field \times \VecSpace{X}_2$ which corresponds to the case $k=2$ and $\VecSpace{X}_1=\Field$ with the 
identity discretization.

\subsection{Compatibility of maps w.r.t.\@ discretizations}
We proceed by investigating natural conditions that a discretization should fulfill. Often, 
we need to perform various operatons on $\VecSpace{X}$ and there are corresponding natural 
operations on $\Field^{n}$. It is then important that such operations are compatible w.r.t.\@ the discretization. 
In the general setting, most of these operations can be stated as maps between appropriately chosen vector 
spaces. Thus, we begin with defining the notion of compatibility of maps w.r.t.\@ discretizations. 
\begin{definition}\label{def:MapComp}
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$ be vector spaces over $\Field$ with discretizations 
  $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}):=\{\VecSpace{X}, \Field^{n},R^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n},E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n} \}$ and 
  $\discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y}):=\{ \VecSpace{Y}, \Field^{m},R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m},E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m}\}$,   
  respectively. Now, consider the maps 
  \[  \Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{Y}   \quad\text{and}\quad    
      \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \colon \Field^{n} \to \Field^{m}.   \]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{$\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}$ (exactly) correspond to each 
  other under the discretizations $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ and  $\discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y})$} if 
  the following holds for any $n,m \in \Natural$:
  \[ R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \Op{T} = \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}
     \quad\text{and}\quad
     E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} = \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}.
  \]
  \item \emph{$\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}$ approximately correspond to 
  each other under the discretizations $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$  and  $\discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y})$}
  if the following holds:
  \begin{align*} 
    \lim_{n,m\to \infty} 
       \Bigl\Vert R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \Op{T} - \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n} \Bigr\Vert_{m} &= 0 
     \\[0.5em]
     \lim_{n,m\to \infty} 
       \Bigl\Vert E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} - \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} 
       \Bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}} &= 0.
  \end{align*} 
  \end{enumerate}  
  If any of the above holds, then we say that $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}$ are compatible.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Identity with finite range}
There are two natural approximations to the identity mappings on $\VecSpace{Y}$ and $\VecSpace{X}$, 
namely $P^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \colon \VecSpace{Y} \to \VecSpace{Y}$ and 
$P^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}\colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{X}$ given as 
\[  P^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} := E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m}
   \quad\text{and}\quad
   P^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n} := E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n} \circ R^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}.
\]   
Both these operators do in some sense corresponds to the identity mapping but they have a finite dimensional range.

With these we may re-phrase the conditions for exact correspondence in Definition~\ref{def:MapComp}
in a way that is sometimes more useful. If $\VecSpace{X}$ is a Hilbert space, then
\begin{align*}
  E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} = \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}
    &\quad\iff\quad
    \Op{T} = P^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \Op{T}
    \text{ on $\range(E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}) \subset \VecSpace{X}$} \\
 R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \Op{T} = \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}
    &\quad\iff\quad
    \Op{T} = \Op{T} \circ P^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}
    \text{ on $\range(E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}) \subset \VecSpace{X}$}     
\end{align*}

\[  \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} = E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} 
      = E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \Op{T} \circ E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}
\]
which is equivalent to assuming that 
\[  \Op{T} = E^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ R^{\VecSpace{Y}}_{m} \circ \Op{T}
     \quad\text{on the vector space $\range(E^{\VecSpace{X}}_{n}) \subset \VecSpace{X}$.} 
\]
In a similar way, 

In the following, we investigate the consequences of the above definition for some rather common operations
on vector spaces.





\subsubsection{Compatibility of vector space operations}
Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be a vector space over $\Field$ and 
$\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}):=\{\VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n}\}$ an $n$-dimensional discretization of 
$\VecSpace{X}$.  Both $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ are vector spaces over the field $\Field$. 
Many numerical algorithms are 
formulated directly in $\Field^{n}$ and utilize the natural vector space operations in $\Field^{n}$. Therefore it is of
interest to investigate the relation between the vector space operations in $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$.

\begin{theorem}\label{ThmVecSpaceCorr}
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be a vector space over $\Field$ with discretization $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$. Then,
  the vector space operations between $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ correspond
  to each other in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp} only when the discretization is linear.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let us begin with the  group laws on the vector spaces $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ which can be 
represented by the maps $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{2n,n}$ defined as  
\[ \Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \times \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{X} 
    \quad\text{where}\quad \Op{T}(x,y):=x+y \] 
and $+$ denotes the group law in $\VecSpace{X}$ and 
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{2n,n} \colon \Field^{n} \times \Field^{n} \to \Field^{n} 
   \quad\text{where}\quad \DiscOp{T}_{2n,n}(a,b):=a+b \] 
and $+$ denotes the group law in $\Field^{n}$. Then the group laws on $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ 
correspond to each other whenever $T$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{2n,n}$ correspond,
in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp},  under the discretizations $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ 
and the product discretization of $\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}$, \ie,
\[ R_{n} \circ \Op{T} =  \DiscOp{T}_{2n,n} \circ R_{2n}^{\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}} 
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   E_{n}\circ \DiscOp{T}_{2n,n} = \Op{T} \circ E_{2n}^{\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}},
\]
which can be rephrased as
\[ R_{n}(x+y) =  R_{n}(x)+R_{n}(y) 
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   E_{n}(a+b) = E_{n}(a)+E_{n}(b).
\]
Similarly, the vector space multiplication in the vector spaces $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ 
can be represented by the maps $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n}$ defined as
\[ \Op{T} \colon \Field \times \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{X} 
   \quad\text{where}\quad \Op{T}(\alpha,x):=\alpha \cdot x \] 
and $\cdot$ denotes the vector space multiplication in $\VecSpace{X}$ and 
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n} \colon  \Field \times \Field^{n} \to \Field^{n} 
   \quad\text{where}\quad \DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n}(\alpha,a):=\alpha\cdot a  \] 
and $\cdot$ denotes the vector space multiplication in $\Field^{n}$. Again, 
the vector space multiplications on $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ 
correspond to each other whenever $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n}$ correspond,
in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp}, under the discretizations $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ 
and the product discretization of  $\Field \times \Field^{n}$, \ie,
\[ R_{n} \circ \Op{T} =  \DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n} \circ R_{n+1}^{\Field \times \VecSpace{X}}
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   E_{n}\circ \DiscOp{T}_{n+1,n} =  \Op{T} \circ E_{n+1}^{\Field \times \VecSpace{X}},
\]
which can be rephrased as
\[ R_{n}(\alpha x) =  \alpha R_{n}(x) 
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   E_{n}(\alpha a) = \alpha E_{n}(a).
\]
Thus, we see that the vector space operations between $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ correspond
to each other only when the discretization $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ is linear.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Compatibility of norms and inner products}
We now consider the setting when $\VecSpace{X}$ be a normed vector space and when 
$\VecSpace{X}$ is an inner product space. Since there is a natural norm and inner product on
$\Field^{n}$, it is natural to consider compatibility of norms and inner products. 
\begin{theorem}\label{ThmNormInnerProd}
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be a normed vector space over $\Field$ with $n$-dimensional
  discretization $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}):=\{\VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n}\}$. 
  Then the norm on $\VecSpace{X}$ corresponds to the norm of $\Field^{n}$ 
  in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp} only when the discretization is an isometry. 
  Likewise, if $\VecSpace{X}$ is an inner product space, then its inner product corresponds to the 
  inner product of $\Field^{n}$ only when the discretization is angle preserving.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}$ denote the norm of $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{n}$ is the 
norm of $\Field^{n}$. These norms can be represented by the maps $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,1}$ 
defined as  
\[ \Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X}  \to [0,\infty[  \quad\text{where}\quad \Op{T}(x):=\Vert x \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} \] 
and 
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{n,1} \colon \Field^{n} \to [0,\infty[  \quad\text{where}\quad \DiscOp{T}(a):=\Vert a \Vert_{n}. \] 
Then the norms on $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ 
correspond to each other whenever $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,1}$ correspond,
in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp},  under the discretizations $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ 
and the identity discretization of  $[0,\infty[$, \ie,
\[  \Op{T} =  \DiscOp{T}_{n,1} \circ R_{n}
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   \DiscOp{T}_{n,1} =  \Op{T} \circ E_{n},
\]
which can be rephrased as
\[ \Vert x \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} = \bigl\Vert R_{n}(x) \bigr\Vert_{n}
    \quad \text{and}\quad
   \Vert a \Vert_{n} = \bigl\Vert E_{n}(a) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}.
\]
Thus, the norms of normed vector spaces $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ correspond
to each other only when the discretization $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ is an isometry. 

Let us now consider the inner product. Then we assume that $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ are inner 
product spaces with inner products $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_\VecSpace{X}$ and $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_{n}$, 
respectively. The corresponding maps $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{2n,1}$ are 
defined as  
\[ \Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \times \VecSpace{X}  \to \Field  \quad\text{where}\quad \Op{T}(x,y):=\ip{x}{y}_{\VecSpace{X}} \] 
and 
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{2n,1} \colon \Field^{n} \times \Field^{n}  \to \Field  \quad\text{where}\quad \DiscOp{T}_{2n,1}(a,b):=\ip{a}{b}_{n}. \] 
The inner products on $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ 
correspond to each other in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:MapComp} 
whenever $\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{2n,1}$ correspond to each other 
under the product discretization of $\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}$ and the identity discretization of 
$\Field$, \ie, whenever 
\[ \Op{T} =  \DiscOp{T}_{2n,1} \circ R_{2n}^{\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}} 
   \quad\text{and}\quad 
   \DiscOp{T}_{2n,1} =  \Op{T} \circ E_{2n}^{\VecSpace{X}\times \VecSpace{X}}.
\]
This can be rephrased as
\[ \ip{x}{y}_{\VecSpace{X}} =  \ip{R_{n}(x)}{R_{n}(y)}_{n}
    \quad\text{and}\quad 
   \ip{a}{b}_{n} = \ip{E_{n}(a)}{E_{n}(b)}_{\VecSpace{X}}.
\]
Hence, the inner products of $\VecSpace{X}$ corresponds to the inner product of $\Field^{n}$ 
only when the discretization $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ of $\VecSpace{X}$ is angle preserving.
\end{proof}
Finally, we conclude this section by considering standard discretizations of $n$-dimensional vector spaces
w.r.t.\@ a fixed basis. 
\begin{theorem}
  Let $B$ be a basis of the $n$-dimensional inner product space $\VecSpace{X}$ and 
  consider the standard discretization w.r.t.\@ this basis. 
   Then, $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ have corresponding inner products if and only if $B$ is an 
   orthonormal basis.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $B := \{ v_1, \ldots, v_n \}$ denote the basis of $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\{ \VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n}\}$ 
is the standard discretization w.r.t.\@ $B$. This is a linear discretization and for any two elements 
$x,y \in \VecSpace{X}$ there are $\alpha,\beta\in\Field^{n}$ such that 
\[  x = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i \quad\text{and}\quad y = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j v_j. \]
Now, by definition
\[ 
   \ip{x}{y}_{\VecSpace{X}} = \ip{\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i }{\sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}} 
    =    \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i\beta_j \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}
\]
and
\begin{align*}
   \ip{R_{n}(x)}{R_{n}(y)}_{n} &=
       \ip{R_{n}\biggl( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i  \biggr) }
           {R_{n} \biggl( \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j v_j  \biggr)}_{n} \\
  &= \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \beta_j \ip{R_{n}(v_i)}{R_{n}(v_j)}_{n} =
        \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \beta_j \ip{\ve_i}{\ve_j}_{n}
\end{align*}
where $\ve_i\in\Field^{n}$ is the vector with $1$ at $i$:th position and zeroes otherwise. 
Hence, we see that $\ip{x}{y}_{\VecSpace{X}} =  \ip{R_{n}(x)}{R_{n}(y)}_{n}$ if and only if 
\[ \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}=\ip{\ve_i}{\ve_j}_{n}. \]
Conversely,
\[ \ip{E_{n}(\alpha)}{E_{n}(\beta)}_{\VecSpace{X}} =
       \ip{  \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i }{ \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j v_j }_{\VecSpace{X}} 
   = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \beta_j \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}.
\]
so $ \ip{\alpha}{\beta}_{n} = \ip{E_{n}(\alpha)}{E_{n}(\beta)}_{\VecSpace{X}}$ if and only if 
\[  \ip{\alpha}{\beta}_{n} =  \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \beta_j \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}. \]
To summarize, $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ have corresponding inner products if and only if 
\[  \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}= \ip{\ve_i}{\ve_j}_{n}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \ip{\alpha}{\beta}_{n} = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \beta_j \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}}. \]
The natural inner product on $\Field^{n}$ is given by 
$\ip{\alpha}{\beta}_{n} :=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i \beta_i$. With this definition we see that 
$\VecSpace{X}$ and $\Field^{n}$ have corresponding inner products if and only if $\VecSpace{X}$ is equipped with an 
orthonormal basis $B$, \ie, 
\[ \ip{v_i}{v_j}_{\VecSpace{X}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $i=j$,} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Discretization of spaces of linear maps}
Let $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$ denote two vector spaces over $\Field$ with 
$n$- and $m$-dimensional discretizations 
$\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}) := \{ \VecSpace{X}, \Field^{n}, R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}},E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \}$
and
%    \quad\text{and}\quad
    $\discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y}) := \{ \VecSpace{Y}, \Field^{m}, R_{m}^{\VecSpace{X}},E_{m}^{\VecSpace{X}} \}$.
%\]    
We now define $\VecSpace{M}:=\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{X},\VecSpace{Y})$ as the vector space of linear bounded maps
between $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$. Similarly, we have the vector space $M_{n,m}$
of linear mappings from $\Field^{n}$ to $\Field^{m}$, which are represented by $(m \times n)$-matrices with elements in 
$\Field$.

We start off by defining the natural discretization of $\VecSpace{M}$. An element $\Op{T} \in \VecSpace{M}$
is a map $\Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{Y}$, so it is natural to define a discretization 
\[ 
 \discr_{m n}(\VecSpace{M}) := \{ \VecSpace{M}, \Field^{m n}, R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}},E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}} \} 
\]
where
\[ 
R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T}) := R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} 
\quad\text{and}\quad
E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T}) := E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \DiscOp{T} \circ R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}.
\]
Also, the natural norms on $\VecSpace{M}$ and $\Field^{mn}$ are 
\[  \Vert \Op{T} \Vert_{\VecSpace{M}} := \sup_{f \neq 0} \frac{\bigl\Vert \Op{T}(f) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}}{\Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}} 
   \quad\text{and}\quad
   \Vert \DiscOp{T} \Vert_{m,n} := \sup_{\valpha \neq \vzero} 
     \frac{\bigl\Vert \DiscOp{T}(\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{m}}{\Vert \valpha \Vert_{n}}. 
\]

The goal now is to derive conditions on $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ and $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{Y})$ so that
vector space operations on $M_{n,m}$ correspond to those of $\VecSpace{M}$ under the natural discretization of $\VecSpace{M}$.
Similarly, we investigate the behavior of the operator norms under these discretizations.
\begin{theorem}
Assume $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ and $ \discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y})$ are linear discretizations of 
$\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$. Then the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Vector space operations on $M_{m,n}$ correspond to those on 
$\VecSpace{M}$ under the discretization $\discr_{m n}(\VecSpace{M})$.
\item If 
  $\Vert E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^n, \VecSpace{X})} \leq 1$
  and 
 $\Vert R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{Y},\Field^m)} \leq 1$,
 then $\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{M},\Field^{mn})} \leq 1$.%
 \label{IsoIneq1}%
\item If 
  $\Vert E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^m, \VecSpace{Y})} \leq 1$ 
  and
  $\Vert R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{X},\Field^n)} \leq 1$, 
  then $\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^{mn}, \VecSpace{M})} \leq 1$.%
  \label{IsoIneq2}%
\end{enumerate}
In particular, the conditions in \eqref{IsoIneq1} and \eqref{IsoIneq2} hold whenever all restriction and extension maps 
are isometries.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\discr_{m n}(\VecSpace{M})$ is a linear discretization of $\VecSpace{M}$ since 
$\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ and $ \discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y})$ are linear discretizations. Hence,
by Theorem~\ref{ThmVecSpaceCorr}, the vector space operations on $\Field^{m n}$ correspond to those on $\VecSpace{M}$.
Since the space operations on $\Field^{m n}$ correspond trivially to those on $M_{n,m}$, we conclude that 
vector space operations on $M_{m,n}$ correspond to those on $\VecSpace{M}$.

Next, let us consider the claim in \eqref{IsoIneq1}. By definition,
\[
  \bigl\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T}) \bigr\Vert_{m,n}
  = 
  \sup_{\substack{\valpha \in \Field^n \\ \Vert \valpha \Vert_n \leq 1}}
    \bigl\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T})(\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{m}    
  =   
  \sup_{\substack{\valpha \in \Field^n\\ \Vert \valpha \Vert_n\leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} (\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{m}.
\]
Now, $\Vert R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{Y},\Field^m)} \leq 1$ so
\[
  \bigl\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T}) \bigr\Vert_{m,n}
  \leq 
  \sup_{\substack{\valpha \in \Field^n\\ \Vert \valpha \Vert_n\leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} (\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}
  =
  \sup_{\substack{f = E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}\!(\valpha) \\ \Vert \valpha \Vert_n\leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} (\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}.
\]
Since $\Vert E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^n, \VecSpace{X})} \leq 1$,
we get 
\[
  \bigl\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T}) \bigr\Vert_{m,n}
  \leq 
  \sup_{\substack{f  \in \VecSpace{X} \\ \Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} \leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert \Op{T} (f) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}
  =
    \Vert \Op{T} \Vert_{\VecSpace{M}}.
\]
Hence, $\Vert R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{M},\Field^{mn})} \leq 1$ which 
proves the claim in \eqref{IsoIneq1}.

Let us finally consider the claim in \eqref{IsoIneq2}. By definition,
\[
  \bigl\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T}) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{M}}
  = 
  \sup_{\substack{f \in \VecSpace{X} \\ \Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} \leq 1}}
    \bigl\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T})(f) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}    
  =   
  \sup_{\substack{f \in \VecSpace{X} \\ \Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} \leq 1}}
    \bigl\Vert E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \DiscOp{T} \circ R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}(f) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{Y}}.
\]
Now, $\Vert E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^m, \VecSpace{Y})} \leq 1$  so
\[
  \bigl\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T}) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{M}}
  \leq 
  \sup_{\substack{f \in \VecSpace{X} \\ \Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}} \leq 1}}
    \bigl\Vert \DiscOp{T} \circ R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}(f) \bigr\Vert_{m}
  =
  \sup_{\substack{\valpha = R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}\!(f) \\ \Vert f \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}\leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert \DiscOp{T}(\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{m}.
\]
Since $\Vert R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\VecSpace{X},\Field^n)} \leq 1$,
we get 
\[
  \bigl\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T}) \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{M}}
  \leq 
  \sup_{\substack{ \valpha \in \Field^n \\ \Vert \valpha \Vert_{n} \leq1}}
    \bigl\Vert \DiscOp{T}(\valpha) \bigr\Vert_{m}
  =
    \Vert \DiscOp{T} \Vert_{m,n}.
\]
Hence, $\Vert E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}} \Vert_{\VecSpace{L}(\Field^{mn},\VecSpace{M})} \leq 1$ which 
proves the claim in \eqref{IsoIneq2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The claim in \eqref{IsoIneq1} states that the norm of the discretized linear operator $\DiscOp{T}=R_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\Op{T})$ 
is bounded by the norm than $\Op{T}$. Thus, by computing the matrix norm of the discretized linear operator $\DiscOp{T}$
we get a lower bound of the operator norm of $\Op{T}$. 

Conversely, the claim in \eqref{IsoIneq2} states that the operator norm of the continuous extension 
$E_{m n}^{\VecSpace{M}}(\DiscOp{T})$ of a discrete linear operator $\DiscOp{T}$ is bounded by the 
matrix norm of $\DiscOp{T}$. Thus, we can get an upper bound for the continuous extension of a 
discrete mapping in terms of the matrix norms of the latter.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The adjoint}


\subsection{Discretization of the differential}

\subsection{Discretization of equations}
Let us now turn to discretization of equations in Banach spaces.
\begin{definition} 
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be an infinite dimensional Banach space with norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}$. 
  Assume that for each $n=1,2,\ldots$ we are given an $n$-dimensional  discretization
  \[ \discr_{n} := \{ \VecSpace{X}, \Field^{n}, R_{n},E_{n} \}. \]
  Then we say that the  sequence $\{ \discr_{n} \}_{n}$ of $n$-dimensional discretizations 
  of $\VecSpace{X}$ is \emph{compatible} whenever
  \[ \lim_{n\to \infty} 
     \bigl\Vert ( E_{n}\circ R_{n})(f)-f \bigr\Vert_{\VecSpace{X}}\to 0
    \quad\text{for all $f\in \VecSpace{X}$.}\]
\end{definition}
Thus, if one has a sequence $\{ \discr_{n} \}_{n}$ of $n$-dimensional discretizations 
of $\VecSpace{X}$, then for large $n$ one can make the approximation that 
$E_{n}\circ  R_{n}$ is the identity operator, \ie,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fApprox}
  f \approx E_{n}(f_{n}) \quad\text{where}\quad
  f_{n}:=R_{n}(f).
\end{equation}
\begin{definition}
  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$ be Hilbert spaces over the field $\Field$ and $\Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{Y}$. 
  Also, let 
  \[  \discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X}):=\bigl\{ \VecSpace{X},\Field^{n},R_{n},E_{n} \bigr\} 
     \quad\text{and}\quad
     \discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y}):=\bigl\{ \VecSpace{Y},\Field^{m},R_{m},E_{m} \bigr\}\]
  denote $n$- and $m$-dimensional discretizations of $\VecSpace{X}$ and $\VecSpace{Y}$, 
  respectively. Then a map $\DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \colon \Field^{n} \to \Field^{m}$ is the
  \emph{discretization of $\Op{T}$ w.r.t.\@ $\discr_{n}(\VecSpace{X})$ and $\discr_{m}(\VecSpace{Y})$},  
  whenever 
  \[ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} = R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \quad\text{or}\quad
    \Op{T} = E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \circ R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}. \]
  The problem of  solving the equation
   \[  \Op{T}(f)=g \quad\text{for $f\in \VecSpace{X}$ when $g\in \VecSpace{Y}$ is given,} \]
  is \emph{discretized} as solving 
  \[   \DiscOp{T}_{n,m}(a)=b \quad\text{for $a\in \Field^{n}$ when $b\in \Field^{m}$ is given.} \]
\end{definition}  
\begin{remark}
Note that we do \emph{not require that both  
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} = R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \Op{T} \circ E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \quad\text{and}\quad
    \Op{T} = E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}} \circ \DiscOp{T}_{n,m} \circ R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}} \]
holds}. This would imply that  $R_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}}$ and $R_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}$ are the inverses of $E_{m}^{\VecSpace{Y}}$ and 
$E_{n}^{\VecSpace{X}}$, respectively, which is way to strong. Moreover, note that the requirement that 
$\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}$ is a discretization of $\Op{T}$ is stronger than  the requirement that 
$\Op{T}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}$ correspond to each other.
\end{remark}

\begin{examp}
Let us consider a simple example which is the 
Galerkin method in Hilbert space $\VecSpace{X}$. Let $\{ \phi_{i} \}_{i}\subset \VecSpace{X}$ be a 
complete orthonormal system in the separable Hilbert space $\VecSpace{X}$ and 
$\Op{T} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \VecSpace{X}$. 
Let $R_{n} \colon \VecSpace{X} \to \Field^{n}$ be the orthogonal projection operator 
from $\VecSpace{X}$ onto $\Field^{n}$, \ie,
\[ R_{n}(f)= \bigl( \ip{\phi_{1}}{f}_{\VecSpace{X}}, \ldots, \ip{\phi_{n}}{f}_{\VecSpace{X}} \bigr)
   \quad\text{for all $f\in \VecSpace{X}$.} \]
Moreover, let $E_{n}\colon \Field^{n} \to \VecSpace{X}$ be the corresponding embedding operator, so
\[ E_{n}(\alpha)= \sum_{i?1}^n \alpha_i \phi_{i}
   \quad\text{for all $\alpha\in \Field^{n}$.} \]
Then, $R_{n}(f)\to f$ as $n\to \infty$, so the discretizations of $\VecSpace{X}$ are 
compatible. Moreover, the discretization $\DiscOp{T}_{n,n}$ of $\Op{T}$ where 
\[ \DiscOp{T}_{n,n}:=R_{n}\circ \Op{T} \circ E_{n} \]
is consistent with the discretization of $\VecSpace{X}$ and the equation
$\Op{T}(f)=g$ can be replaced with 
\[ \ip{\DiscOp{T}(f_{n})}{\phi_{j}}_{\VecSpace{X}}=\ip{g}{\phi_{j}}_{\VecSpace{X}}
   \quad\text{$f_{n}\in \Field^{n}$ and $j=1,\ldots,n$.} \]
\end{examp}

\section{Specific discretizations}
We will now consider a specific family of discretizations of a Hilbert space $\VecSpace{X}$ over the 
field $\Field$ which contains all the cases we are interested in. 
\begin{definition}
  Let $V:=\{ \phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{m} \}\subset \VecSpace{X}$ be a fixed finite subset of $m$ elements in $\VecSpace{X}$.
  Then we make the following definitions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The \emph{restriction operator $R_{m}(\cdot;V)$ induced by $V$} is the  mapping  
    \[ R_{m}(\cdot;V) \colon H \to \Field^{m} \]
    where 
    \[ R_{m}(f;V):=\bigl( r_{1}(f;V),\ldots,r_{m}(f;V) \bigr) 
       \quad\text{for all $f\in \VecSpace{X}$,} \]
    with $r_{i}(f;V)\in \Field$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$.
  \item The \emph{extension operator $E_{m}(\cdot;V)$ induced by 
    $V$} is defined as the mapping  
    \[ E_{m}(\cdot;V) \colon \Field^{m} \to \VecSpace{X} \]
    where 
    \[ E_{m}(\beta;V):=  \sum_{i=1}^m \beta_i \phi_{i}
       \quad\text{for all $\beta\in \Field^{m}$.} \]      
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


We do not further specify how $r_{i}(\cdot;V)$ is defined.
    Simply note that two choices of $r_{i}(\cdot;V)$ are common, namely
    $r_{i}(f;V):=f(x_{i})$ where $x_{i}\in \VecSpace{X}$ is a fixed point (a sample 
    point) and $r_{i}(f;V):=\ip{f}{\phi_{i}}_{H}$ which is natural whenever
    $V$ is a subset of an orthonormal basis in $H$. Also, 
    $r_{i}(\cdot;V)$ is linear in both these cases.
    In this context the elements in $V$ are called the 
    \emph{sampling functions}.

Note that the sets of sampling and extrapolation functions do not 
need to coincide.  The only requirement is that the number of 
elements $m$ must be the same. Thus, a pair 
$(V^m_{\rest},V^m_{\ext})$ of $m$ 
sampling and extrapolation functions defines an $m$-dimensional 
discretization of $H$ by the tuple
\[ \bigl\{
     H,Z^m,R_{m}(\cdot;V^m_{\rest}),E_{m}(\cdot;V^m_{\ext})
   \bigr\}. \]
   
Now, consider two the following two pairs $(V^n_{\rest},V^n_{\ext})$ and 
$(V^m_{\rest},V^m_{\ext})$ of $n$ and $m$ sampling and extrapolation 
functions:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  V^n_{\rest} &:=\{ \phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n} \} &\qquad
  V^m_{\rest} &:=\{ \psi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{m} \}  \\
  V^n_{\ext} &:=\{ \wt{\phi}_{1},\ldots,\wt{\phi}_{n} \} &\qquad
  V^m_{\ext} &:=\{ \wt{\psi}_{1},\ldots,\wt{\psi}_{m} \}    
\end{alignat*}
Each pair yields a discretization of $\cF_{\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z)$ by the tuples
\[ 
   \bigl\{
     \cF_{\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z),Z^n,R_{n}(\cdot;V^n_{\rest}),E_{n}(\cdot;V^n_{\ext})
   \bigr\} \]
and
\[ \bigl\{
     \cF_{\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z),Z^m,R_{m}(\cdot;V^m_{\rest}),E_{m}(\cdot;V^m_{\ext})
   \bigr\}. \] 
What is the relation between these two discretizations? A function 
$f\in \cF_{\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z)$ is represented by the ``vectors'' 
\[ z_{n}:= R_{n}(f;V^n_{\rest})\in Z^n \quad\text{and}\quad
   z_{m}:= R_{m}(\cdot;V^m_{\rest})\in Z^m \]
and we seek the relaation between $z_{n}$ and $z_{m}$. 
Now making use of the approximation $f\approx 
E_{n}(z_{n};V^n_{\ext})$, \ie,
\[ f \approx x \mapsto 
       \sum_{i=1}^n z_{n,i} \wt{\phi}_{i}(x)
   \quad\text{in $\cF_{\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z)$,} 
\]
which implies that
\begin{align*}
  z_{m} &:=R_{m}(f;V^m_{\rest}) =
    \bigl( r_{1}(f,V^m_{\rest}),\ldots,r_{m}(f,V^m_{\rest}) \bigr) \\
    &\approx 
      \Bigl( r_{1}\bigl(E_{n}(z_{n},V^n_{\ext}),V^m_{\rest}\bigr),
             \ldots,
	     r_{m}\bigl(E_{n}(z_{n},V^n_{\ext}),V^m_{\rest}\bigr)
      \Bigr).
\end{align*}
When $r_{k}(\cdot,V^m_{\rest})$ are linear, then 
\[ r_{k}\bigl(E_{n}(z_{n},V^n_{\ext}),V^m_{\rest}\bigr)=
     r_{k}\biggl(\sum_{i=1}^n 
       z_{n,i}\wt{\phi}_{i}(\cdot),V^m_{\rest}\biggr)=
     \sum_{i=1}^n z_{n,i} r_{k}(\wt{\phi}_{i},V^m_{\rest}).
\]   
Thus, for $k=1,\ldots,m$
\[
  z_{m,k}\approx 
    \sum_{i=1}^n z_{n,i} r_{k}(\wt{\phi}_{i},V^m_{\rest}).
\]    
and defining 
\[ A_{i,k}:= r_{k}(\wt{\phi}_{i},V^m_{\rest})
   \text{ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and $j=1,\ldots,m$,} \]
enables us to write
\[ z_{m}=z_{n}\cdot\vA
   \quad\text{where } 
   \vA:=[ A_{i,k} ]_{\substack{1\leq i \leq n \\ 1\leq k \leq m}}
   \text{ is an $(n\times m)$-matrix.} \]
Conversly, defining 
\[ \wt{A}_{k,i}:=r_{i}(\phi_{k},V^n_{\rest})
   \text{ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and $k=1,\ldots,m$,} \]
enables us to write
\[ z_{n}=z_{m}\cdot\wt{\vA}
   \quad\text{where } 
   \wt{\vA}:=[ \wt{A}_{i,k} ]_{\substack{1\leq k \leq M \\ 
   1\leq i \leq n}}
   \text{ is an $(m\times n)$-matrix.} \]
Finally, if $V^n_{\rest}=V^n_{\rest}$ and 
$V^m_{\ext}=V^m_{\rest}$, then $\vA=\wt{\vA}^T$. 
%
%
%\paragraph{Discretization of functions spaces.}
%We begin by introducing some useful notation that well be used 
%throughout this section.
%\begin{Not}
%  Let $\VecSpace{X}$ be a topological space, $\mu$ a fixed 
%  Borel measure, $\Field$ a field, and $Z$ a vector space over $\Field$. 
%  Then we define $\cL^1_{\loc,\Field}(\VecSpace{X},Z)$ as the Hilbert space over $\Field$ of
%  locally $\mu$-measurable functions 
%  $f\colon \VecSpace{X}\to Z$. The notation $\cL^1(\domain)$ simply stands for 
%  $\cL^1_{\loc,\Real}(\domain,\Real)$.
%\end{Not}  
%Throughout this section $Z$ and $W$ are vector spaces over the 
%fields $\Field$ and $\Field'$ and $\VecSpace{X}, \VecSpace{Y}$ are topological spaces.
%Also, let
%\[ \VecSpace{X}:=\cF_{\Field}(\domain,Z)\subset \cL^1_{\loc,\Field}(\domain,Z) \]
%denote a  Hilbert subspace.   
%
%
%\section{Relation to inverse problems}
%Let $\VecSpace{X}, \VecSpace{Y}$ be topological spaces and $T \colon \cF(X,\Field) \to 
%\cF(\VecSpace{Y},\Field')$. The inverse problem we are interested in is to find 
%$f\in H_{\VecSpace{X}}:=\cF(X,\Field)$ that solves the operator equation $T(f)=g$ where 
%$g\in H_{\VecSpace{Y}}:=\cF(Y,\Field')$ is 
%known only on a subset $Y_{0}\subset Y$. In reality $Y_{0}$ is a 
%finite set, so $g$ is known only at a finite number of points in $Y$. 
%
%This enables us to replace the continuous inverse  is given, with a sequence of 
%discrete inverse problems of finding $f_{n}\in H_{n}$ such that 
%$\DiscOp{T}_{n,m}(f_{n})=R_{m}(g)$.
%
%Finally, note that the dimension of the discretization of  $\cF(Y,W)$ 
%occurring in the inverse problem in subsection~\ref{sec:Inv} is naturally 
%determined by the fact that $T(f_{\true})$ is known (up to measurement 
%errors) on a given set $Y_{0}\subset Y$ with $m$ elements. 
%It is natural to choose an $m$-dimensional discretization of 
%$\cF(Y,W)$ where the choice of the sampling and extrapolation functions are 
%related to the elements in $Y_{0}$.
%
%
%
%   
%\section{The object model}
%What we are looking for is an efficient object structure representing 
%the discretization problem described above. The idea is that given an 
%operator 
%\[ T \colon \cF(X) \to \cF(Y) \]
%the object structure in the code must represent the discretization to 
%the level of accuracy that enables one to change between different
%discretizations $\DiscOp{T}_{N,M}$ and $\DiscOp{T}_{N',M'}$ of $T$, at least 
%for different sample based discretizations.
%
%The naive way to model the object structure is to fully replicate the 
%mathematical setting (fields, vector spaces over fields, normed spaces, Hilbert 
%spaces over fields, etc) but this produces a very large object structure 
%that we believe is not feasible nor necessary. The idea that we have 
%played with
%is to have an object structure that is general enough to capture different 
%choices of sample based discretizations and relations in between them 
%without being inefficient. 
%As an example, what possible function spaces $\cF(X)$ do we have? Well, 
%mathematically this depends on $T$ and examples for $X=\Real^n$ 
%are $\Cc_{c}(\Real^n)$ (continuous functions with compact 
%support), $\Cc^\infty_{c}(\Real^n)$ (smooth functions with compact 
%support), and 
%$\mathcal{S}(\Real^n)$ (functions in the Schwartz class, \ie, fast 
%decaying smooth functions). When using 
%a sample based discretization it is actually not relevant exactly which 
%Hilbert space that one started with. The only important factor is the 
%underlying field and the inner product (which affects the inner 
%product in the finite dimensional representation) since the same 
%sample based discretization yields the same finite dimensional representation for 
%all Hilbert spaces over the same field with the same inner product structure.
%As an example a fixed sample based discretization can not differ between bounded 
%integrable functions or 
%continuous functions if the inner product that we use is the same. 
%Hence, a Hilbert space may be represented by the underlying field 
%($\Real$, $\Complex$,\ldots), and the inner product structure (or at least its 
%discrete counterpart).
%
%\subsection{Consistency checks}
%It is desirable that the object model can check for consisteny. The 
%first problem is to be able to compare two discretizations and 
%determine if they are the same.
%
%As already noted, in order to describe the discretizations we are using 
%one only needs the following information:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Representing the Hilbert space $H$. Since $H$ is of the form
%  \[ H:=\cF_{\Field}(X,Z)\subset \cL^1_{\loc,\Field}(X,Z) \] 
%  it is a set of functions from the topological space $X$ into the 
%  vector space $Z$ (vector space over the field $\Field$), $H$ can be described by 
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item The dimension of $H$.
%  \item The underlying field $\Field$  as a set, so we do not bother to encode 
%    the field structure, we see $\Field$ only as a set.
%  \item The domain $X$ as a set, so we do not bother to encode the
%    topology, we see $X$ only as a set. 
%  \item The range $Z$ which is encoded as a set with an underlying 
%   field $\Field$, so we do not bother to encode 
%   the vector space structure of $Z$.
%  \end{enumerate}
%\item The dimension $n$ of the discretization.
%\item The family $V^n_{\rest}$ of sampling functions.
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Basic definitions}
\subsection{Algebraic structures}
We begin with the basic definition of the underlying algebraic objects, namely ring and field.
A field is basically an abstraction of the set $\Real$ of real numbers with the ``usual'' 
addition and multiplication.
\begin{definition}[Ring and field]
  A set $\Field$ is a \emph{ring} if there are two laws of composition
  $(\alpha,\beta)\mapsto \alpha+\beta$ and $(\alpha,\beta) \mapsto \alpha\cdot \beta$, called 
  respectively \emph{addition} and \emph{multiplication}, satisfying the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Field$ is a commutative group under addition with zero element $0_{\Field}$, \ie,
    the following holds for all $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in \Field$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item addition is associative, \ie, $\alpha + (\beta+\gamma)=(\alpha+\beta)+\gamma$,
    \item addition is commutative, \ie, $\alpha + \beta = \beta+\alpha$,
    \item the zero element is the identity element w.r.t.\@ the addition so 
       $\alpha+0_{\Field}=0_{\Field}+\alpha=\alpha$,
    \item $-\alpha$ denotes the inverse of $\alpha$  w.r.t.\@ the addition so 
       $\alpha+(-\alpha)=(-\alpha)+\alpha=0_{\Field}$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item the multiplication is associative and possesses an identity element $1_{\Field}$, \ie,
    the following holds for all $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in \Field$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item multiplication is associative, \ie, 
      $\alpha\cdot (\beta\cdot \gamma)=(\alpha\cdot \beta)\cdot \gamma$,
   \item $1_{\Field}$ is the identity element w.r.t.\@ the multiplication so 
      $1_{\Field}\cdot \alpha=\alpha \cdot 1_{\Field}=\alpha$, 
  \end{enumerate}
  \item the multiplication is distributive with respect to the addition, \ie,
    for all $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in \Field$,
    \[ (\alpha+\beta)\cdot \gamma = \alpha \cdot \gamma+\beta\cdot\gamma 
       \quad\text{and}\quad
       \alpha \cdot (\beta + \gamma) = \alpha \cdot \beta+\alpha\cdot\gamma.
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
  A ring $\Field$ is called a \emph{field} if it does not consist only of $0_{\Field}$ and every non-zero 
  element of $\Field$ has an inverse w.r.t.\@ the multiplication. Finally, a field is \emph{commutative}
  if its multiplication is commutative.
\end{definition}
When working with fields we will simplify the notational burden by not explicitly writing 
the multiplication $\cdot$, \ie, $\alpha \beta$ means $\alpha\cdot\beta$ whenever 
$\alpha,\beta\in\Field$. Moreover, we will write $1$ and $0$ instead of $1_{\Field}$ and $0_{\Field}$.
Having defined the concept of a field, we are now ready to define the concept of a vector 
space.
\begin{definition}[Vector space]
  Let $\Field$ be a fixed field. Then a set $X$ is a \emph{left vector space over $\Field$} if 
  $X$ is a commutative group (the group law will be written additively in what follows)
  together with a map  $(\alpha,x) \mapsto \alpha\cdot x$, called the \emph{vector space 
  multiplication}, where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alpha \cdot (x+y)=\alpha \cdot x+\alpha \cdot y$
     for all $\alpha\in \Field$ and $x,y\in X$,
  \item $(\alpha + \beta) \cdot x= \alpha \cdot x + \beta\cdot x$ 
     for all $\alpha, \beta\in \Field$ and $x\in X$,\label{MII}
  \item $\alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot x) = (\alpha\beta)\cdot x$  
     for all $\alpha, \beta\in \Field$ and $x\in X$,\label{MIII}
  \item $1\cdot x = x$ for all $x\in X$.
  \end{enumerate}
  If \eqref{MIII} above is replaced by the axiom
  \[ \alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot x) = (\beta \alpha)\cdot x
        \quad\text{for all $\alpha, \beta\in \Field$ and $x\in X$,}
  \]
  then we say that $X$ is a \emph{right vector space over $\Field$}. Elements in the 
  field $\Field$ are called \emph{scalars} and elements in $X$ are called \emph{vectors}. 
  Finally,  note that in \eqref{MII} above, the addition $+$ in the left hand side 
  represents the addition in 
  the field $\Field$, whereas in the right hand side it represents the group law in $X$.
\end{definition}  
We say that a subset $V \subset X$ is a \emph{vector subspace of $X$} if $V$ itself is a vector 
space over $\Field$ with the same operations as in $X$. This is equivalent to requiring that 
$0\in V$ and $\alpha x, x+y \in V$ whenever $x,y\in V$ and $\alpha \in \Field$.

Often the vector space multiplication $\cdot$ is not written explicitly. In fact, if $X$ is a 
left (resp.\@ right) vector space over a field $\Field$, then any expression of the type 
$\alpha x$ where $\alpha\in\Field$ and $x\in X$ means $\alpha \cdot x$. Moreover, we will not 
notationally distinguish between the addition in $\Field$ and the group law in $X$, so 
$\alpha + \beta$ refers to the addition in $\Field$ if $\alpha,\beta\in \Field$ and to the group law in 
$X$ if $\alpha,\beta\in X$. In the same way we do not notationally distinguish between the 
zero in $X$ and the zero in $\Field$

Having dealt with the notational conventions, let us now proceed by defining concepts such 
as linear combination, basis, and dimension.
\begin{definition}[Linear combination and independence]
   Let $X$ be a right (resp.\@ left) vector space over a field $\Field$. Also, 
   let $\{ v_1, \ldots, v_{n} \}  \subset X$ be a fixed subset. An element $x\in X$ 
   is said to be a \emph{linear combination of the elements $\{ v_1, \ldots, v_{n} \}$} if 
   there exists a subset $\{ \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n} \} \subset \Field$ such that 
   \[  x= \alpha_1 v_1 + \ldots +  \alpha_{n} v_{n}. \]
   The elements $\{ \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n} \}$ are then called the \emph{coefficients 
  (or coordinates)  of $x$ w.r.t.\@ $\{ v_1, \ldots, v_{n} \}$}. Moreover, we say that this finite 
  set is \emph{linearly independent} if 
   \[ \alpha_1 v_1 + \ldots + \alpha_{n} v_{n} =0
      \quad\text{implies that}\quad \alpha_1=\ldots=\alpha_{n}=0. \]
  Note that the zero in the left hand side is the zero vector in $X$ whereas the zero in the right 
  hand side is the zero in the field $\Field$.
\end{definition}
Using the axiom of choice, one can show, see, \eg, Chapter~II, section~7 in \cite{Bo89}, 
that every vector space $X$ has a maximal linearly independent subset $B \subset X$ 
spanning $X$, \ie, every vector $x\in X$ can be written as a finite linear combination 
of the elements in $B$. Such a maximal subset is called a \emph{(Hamel) basis}. If 
$B$ denotes a basis of the vector space $X$, then any element $x\in X$ has a 
unique representation as a linear combination of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_{n}\in B$, \ie, there 
exists unique scalars $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}\in\Field$ such that 
\[ x = \alpha_1 v_1 + \ldots + \alpha_{n} v_{n}. \]
The scalars $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}$ are then called the  \emph{coordinates/coefficients}
of $x$ with respect to the basis $B$. The \emph{dimension} of $X$ is defined as the cardinality 
of its Hamel basis. Since one can show that any two Hamel basis of $X$ 
have the same cardinality, the concept of dimension is well-defined.
\begin{definition}[Linear map]
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be two (left) vector spaces over the same field $\Field$. A map
  $f \colon X \to Y$ is called a \emph{linear map (homomorphism)} if
  \[  f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y) \quad\text{and}\quad
      f(\alpha x)=\alpha f(x)  \]
  for all $x,y\in X$ and $\alpha\in \Field$.
  Note that $\alpha x$ refers to the vector space multiplication in $X$, whereas $\alpha f(x)$
  refers to the vector space multiplication in $Y$.
  If $X$ and $Y$ are two (right) vector spaces over the same field $\Field$, then we need to
  replace the condition $f(\alpha x)=\alpha f(x)$ with $f(x\alpha)= f(x) \alpha$.
  Finally,  we let  $\Hom_{\Field}(X,Y)$ denote the set of linear maps from $X$ into $Y$.
\end{definition}   
Since any result that holds for left vector spaces over $\Field$ also holds for right vector spaces 
over $\Field$, we shall in the sequel we shall drop the prefix left (resp.\@ right). Moreover, if
the field is commutative, then there is no difference in the sense that any left vector spaces
is also a right vector spaces.

An important class of vector spaces are the product spaces. 
If $X_1, \ldots, \Field^{n}$ are  vector spaces over the same field $\Field$, then we
define the \emph{product space}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ProdSpace}
   X:= X_1 \times \ldots  \times \Field^{n} 
\end{equation}
as the set of elements $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n})$ where $x_i\in X_i$. There is a natural vector 
space structure on $X$, namely, if $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n}), (y_1,\ldots,y_{n})\in X$ and 
$\alpha\in\Field$, then 
\begin{align*}
   (x_1,\ldots,x_{n})+(y_1,\ldots,y_{n}) &:= (x_1+y_1,\ldots,x_{n}+y_{n}) \\
   \alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_{n}) &:= (\alpha x_1,\ldots,\alpha x_{n}).
\end{align*}
Note that $x_i+y_i$ and $\alpha x_i$ refer to the group law and vector space 
multiplication in the vector space $X_i$. It is easy to show that with the above definitions, 
$X$ becomes a vector space over $\Field$. 
For notational simplicity, in many cases one would like to simplify the notation for
elements in a product space $X$. 
%In fact, we will denote such elements by the corresponding 
%bold face letter, \ie, $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n})$ is denoted 
%by $\bx$ and $(y_1,\ldots,y_{n})$ by $\by$, \etc Thus, with this notational convention 
%$\bx_i$ refers to an element in the product space $X$ that is indexed by $i$ and 
%$x_i$ refers to the corresponding element in $X_i$ of $\bx=(x_1,\ldots,x_{n})$. 

Now, if $X$ is a product space defined as in \eqref{eq:ProdSpace}, then the 
\emph{natural projections}
\[ \pi_i \colon X \to X_i \quad\text{are defined as}\quad \pi_i(x):=x_i, \]
and they are surjective linear mappings, \ie, $\pi_i\in\Hom_{\Field}(X,X_i)$. 
Now, it is easy to show, see, \eg, Proposition~4, Section~1.5, Chapter~II in \cite{Bo89}, 
that for any vector space $Y$ over $\Field$ and any finite set of linear maps 
$f_i \in \Hom_{\Field}(Y,X_i)$,  $i=1,\ldots,n$, there exists a unique map 
$f\in \Hom_{\Field}(Y,X)$ such that 
\[ \pi_i \circ f = f_i. \]
Conversely, given $f\in \Hom_{\Field}(Y,X)$, we can always define $f_i \in \Hom_{\Field}(Y,X_i)$ by 
the above relation. 
%We will use the bold face notation $\vf$ on the elements in $\Hom_{\Field}(Y,X)$
%\emph{only} when there is an explicit need to refer to the $f_i$:s.

We will finally define the concepts of norm and inner product for vector spaces over $\Real$ 
or $\Complex$. 
\begin{definition}[Norm and inner product]
  Let $\Field$ be a field of real numbers $\Real$ or complex numbers $\Complex$  with the usual 
  addition and multiplication. Moreover, let $X$ be a vector space over $\Field$. A mapping 
  \[ \Vert \cdot \Vert \colon X \to [0,\infty[ \]
  is called a \emph{norm on $X$} if the following holds for all $x,y \in X$ and $\alpha\in\Field$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Vert \alpha x \Vert = \vert \alpha \vert \, \Vert x \Vert$,
  \item $\Vert x \Vert \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $x$ is the zero element in $X$,
  \item $\Vert x+y \Vert \leq \Vert x \Vert+\Vert y \Vert$.
  \end{enumerate}
  A mapping 
  \[ \ip{\cdot}{\cdot} \colon X\times X \to \Field \]
  is called the \emph{inner product on $X$}
  if the following holds for all $x,y,z \in X$ and $\alpha\in\Field$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ip{x}{y}=\overline{\ip{y}{x}}$,
  \item $\ip{\alpha x}{y}=\overline{\alpha}\ip{x}{y}$ and $\ip{x}{\alpha  y}= \alpha \ip{x}{y}$,
  \item $\ip{x + y}{z} = \ip{x}{z}  +  \ip{y}{z}$,
  \item  $\ip{x}{x}\geq 0$ with equality if and only if $x$ is the zero element in $X$.
  \end{enumerate}
  A vector space with an inner product is called an \emph{inner product (or pre Hilbert) space}
  and a vector space with a norm is called a \emph{normed space}.
\end{definition}
Let $X$ be an inner product space. Then we say that $x,y \in X$ are \emph{orthogonal} 
if $\ip{x}{y}=0$. 


\paragraph{Examples of vector spaces.}
The first example is a trivial one, namely that any field $\Field$ is a one-dimensional 
vector space over itself. The next example is the product space $\Field^{n}$ which is  defined as 
the $n$ fold product of $\Field$, \ie,
\[ \Field^{n} := \underbrace{\Field \times \ldots \times \Field}_{\text{$n$ times}}. \]
Then $\Field^{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space 
over $\Field$. In this setting, $\Field^1$ is isomorphic to $\Field$, so we will identify $\Field^1$ with $\Field$
without further notice. The importance of the vector space $\Field^{n}$ originates from the fact 
that it is the canonical $n$-dimensional vector space. In fact, any $n$-dimensional vector 
space $X$ can be naturally identified 
with $\Field^{n}$. Let  $\{ v_1,\ldots, v_{n} \}$ be a basis of $X$ and define the map 
$\phi \colon X \to \Field^{n}$ as
\[  \phi\Bigl( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i \Bigr) := (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n})\in\Field^{n}
    \quad\text{so}\quad 
    \phi^{-1}(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i.
\]
The above map $\phi$ is an vector space isomorphism which we call the \emph{natural 
isomorphism of $X$ w.r.t.\@ the basis $\{ v_1,\ldots, v_{n} \}$}, so $X$ is isomorphic to $\Field^{n}$.
Let us also mention that in order to comply with the notation used in 
matrix algebra\footnote{Matrix, and more generally, tensor algebra for matrices and tensors with 
elements in a general field $\Field$ is a straightforward generalization of the matrix and 
tensor algebra for matrices and tensors with elements in $\Real$. 
We refer to \cite[Chapter~II, Section~10 and Chapter~III]{Bo89} for the formal details.} 
in $\Field$, a vector $\alpha\in\Field^{n}$ is written as a column vector of its components, 
\ie,
\[ \alpha = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 \\  \vdots \\  \alpha_{n} \end{pmatrix}
   \quad\text{with $\alpha_j \in \Field $ for $j=1,\ldots,n$.}
\]

As a final example,  let $X$ be a set and $Y$ a vector space over a field $\Field$. Now, the 
set $\Map(X,Y)$ of all maps from $X$ into $Y$ has a natural vector space 
structure. In fact, for $f,g\in \Map(X,Y)$ and $\alpha\in\Field$ we define $f+g$ and $\alpha f$ as 
\[ (f+g)(x):= f(x)+g(x) \quad\text{and}\quad (\alpha f)(x):=\alpha f(x) \]
for all $x\in X$. Then, whenever $f+g, \alpha f\in  \Map(X,Y)$, the set $\Map(X,Y)$ becomes
a vector space over $\Field$ under the above definitions of the group law and vector space 
multiplication. An interesting special case is when $X$ is a vector space over $\Field$ and 
$\Map(X,Y)= \Hom_{\Field}(X,Y)$.
