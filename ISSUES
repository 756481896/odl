--- General ---
- When it comes to style, I (Holger) think we should follow PEP8 as closely as possible. (Some things below are taken from there)
- Avoid long lines. 79 characters are the limit.
- Naming scheme: classes should be CamelCase, functions lowercase with underscore if necessary. Keep names short!
- Docstrings: mandatory for all modules, classes, public methods and public functions. Optional for "magic" methods.
- doctest: We can think about having simple tests in the docstrings (see doctest module)
- Wildcard imports: We should only use them as long as there are heavy changes going on in a file. When things converge, switch to explicit imports.
  Also: no wildcard imports without defining __all__!
- Check of input parameters: to what degree should one check input parameters?

--- set.py ---
- Why name "AbstractSet"? Why not just "Set"?
